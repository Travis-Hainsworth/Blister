Create a new folder prefaced with "#_" where # is ascending based on chronological order of creation folded by
a 1 to 2 word descriptor of the project. Include in this new folder a ReadMe.txt that includes the when and why
of your design as well as the hierarchy of the solidworks files. Also include your manufacturing methods
(whether you 3D printed, milled, or lathed, etc.).
