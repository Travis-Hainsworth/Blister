This is the code that is used for the static lateral testing. Some code optimization would be a good impovement.

The only thing you need to change in order to run it is in the "dataProcessing.py", "process_lateral_data" function.
change these 2 lines so that the file path is to the folder containing all your data. The {} should be the name of the rims.

mocap_data.append(get_mocap_data(r"C:\Users\ethan\Test\Static_Lateral\{}\MOCAP".format(rim)))
mts_data.append(get_mts_data(r"C:\Users\ethan\Test\Static_Lateral\{}\MTS".format(rim)))

Then in the "main.py" make sure this list is full of the rim names that are in the file paths.
rims = ['R30 Alloy', 'R30 Carbon', 'Light', 'WAOU']

So an example full file path should look like this:
"C:\Users\ethan\Test\Static_Lateral\R30 Alloy\MOCAP"
